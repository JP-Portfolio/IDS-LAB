# Network Security Analysis and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Implementation

## Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance network security by implementing and configuring an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using Snort. The project aims to understand, simulate, and detect various types of cyber attacks, including brute force, SQL injection, TCP SYN flood, Ping of Death, and Slowloris attacks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the IPS and the importance of robust network security configurations.

### Skills Learned

- **Network Security:** Understanding of various types of cyber attacks and how to detect and mitigate them.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Experience with configuring and using IDS/IPS tools like Snort or Suricata on pfsense.
- **Firewall Configuration:** Knowledge of how to configure firewall rules and settings to improve network security.
- **Packet Analysis:** Ability to use tools like Wireshark to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies.
- **Penetration Testing:** Experience with conducting controlled attacks on a system to test its security, using tools like hping3 and slowhttptest.
- **Cybersecurity Tools:** Proficiency in using various open-source cybersecurity tools (SQLmap, Berpsuite).
- **Technical Documentation:** Ability to document technical processes, findings, and recommendations clearly and effectively.

### Tools Used

- **Snort or Suricata:** Open-source Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) for detecting and preventing cyber attacks.
- **pfSense:** An open-source firewall that provides robust network security features.
- **hping3:** A network tool used to craft TCP/IP packets, used in your project for simulating various types of attacks.
- **slowhttptest:** A tool used to simulate Slowloris attacks.
- **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer used for understanding the network traffic and detecting anomalies.
- **OWASP Juice Shop:** An intentionally insecure web application used for security training and testing.
